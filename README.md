# Hypershare

Hypershare is a decentralised financial infrastructure for equity investment. The protocol allows entrepreneurs to create and manage tokenised equity, automate compliance and raise venture funding. For investors, Hypershare provides a platform not just to invest on-chain but to realise unprecedented liquidity on assets that would have previously been immobile allowing equity shares to be traded like any other crypto asset.

## What is Hypershare?

Hypershare is a digital equity infrastructure for venture investment. Our mission is to broaden access to the blockchain and allow venture founders and investors to harness its radical potential. We believe that decentralised finance is an opportunity to transform the analogue, disconnected and opaque infrastructure of venture investment today. Yet, despite their vast potential the blockchain and DeFi remain arcane and inaccessible to outsiders.

Fundamentally, Hypershare is a control structure. It harnesses trustlessness and governs interactions between parties allowing people to collaborate in ways that would have never been possible and value to flow more efficiently. By creating a shared language for describing equity investments we can standardise interactions increasing automaticity and transferability.

## For Founders

For founders, Hypershare provides a sophisticated suite of smart contracts for the issue and transfer of tokenised equity. These contracts will support an organisation throughout its life and serve as a shared public utility for ventures and investors alike. An organisation's profile will act much like an email address or social media profileâ€”a reliable reference point built for a specific utility.

By tokenizing shares, Hypershare makes it drastically faster, simpler and cheaper for companies to manage equity and begin to raise capital than through traditional means. Instead of needing dedicated support, founders can deploy a suite of smart contracts at the price of gas. These hybrid legal contracts enforce rights both on-chain and off-chain thereby bridging the gap between traditional and decentralised finance.

To support registered assets in a way that is flexible, non-invasive, and scalable Hypershare has created a suite of automated compliance checks that are instrumental in making the compliance process painless. By enforcing compliance as a part of the architecture of the market we can shift the burden onto code and away from users creating a truly frictionless experience that allows value to flow freely.
        
## For Investors

Hypershare allows investors to engage broadly in on-chain venture investment, trading and governance directly from their smart wallets. We hope to be for tokenised equity what Uniswap and Opensea were for their retrospective communities, pioneers of thriving ecosystems that created value for millions of users.

Illiquidity is the single greatest problem in the venture investment industry. It compounds risk, increases the difficulty of every other process and constrains the market based on the type of opportunity investors can realise an exit on. Greater liquidity will not only benefit investors but have direct knock-on effects for founders who seek to raise funding and ultimately, broaden the scope of venture investment allowing it to support a more diverse range of opportunities.

## For Developers 

In the current landscape there are countless equity crowdfunding platforms, the majority of which develop proprietary software to support their operations. Not only is this inefficient but it silos value. For developers Hypershare can be easily integrated via the SDK meaning that each platform can continue to provide individual services for their respective while creating open and composable digital assets that are recorded on the blockchain.

As a platform for programmable value the blockchain opens up a multitude of exciting new use cases, one example of which is on-chain voting. By conducting shareholder votes on-chain it is possible to allow investors to engage directly in the governance no matter how small their shareholding. This is just one of a multitude of use cases that would have previously been impractical or impossible before tokenisation.
