# Hypershare

* Welcome to Hypershare: a digital equity infrastructure for the internet age.*

## What's the problem?

DeFi is finance for the age of the internet, an open global financial system running atop the blockchain. DeFi offers the first radical alternative to the disconnected, opaque, decades-old practices and infrastructure of traditional finance. Having grown from a relative backwater into a thriving several hundred billion industry almost overnight, the community today is at the centre of a technical revolution that will eventually subsume the entire financial sector. But what about the other $27 trillion in capital markets? DeFi has survived up until now by avoiding regulated assets, but for the space to evolve a new type of protocol must emerge.

The collision between regulated assets and permissionless protocols presents a unique set of technical, ethical, and regulatory challenges. Current solutions for building compliant solutions centralise control and reintroduce middlemen who extract value from users and prevent the space from evolving. If the growth of regulated assets in decentralised finance is dependent on intermediaries, it seems doubtful they will ever see wider adoption.

## What is Hypershare?

Hypershare is a digital equity infrastructure for venture investment. Our mission is to broaden access to the blockchain and allow venture founders and investors to harness its radical potential. We believe that decentralised finance is an opportunity to transform the analogue, disconnected and opaque infrastructure of venture investment today. Yet, despite their vast potential the blockchain and DeFi remain arcane and inaccessible to outsiders.

Hypershare allows entrepreneurs to create and manage tokenised equity, automate compliance and raise venture funding. For investors, Hypershare provides a platform to realise unprecedented liquidity on assets that would have previously been immobile, enabling equity shares to be traded like any other crypto asset.

The protocol provides a suite of tools for issuers to create and manage digital equity assets, and further, allows them to bypass the need for complex administrative procedures, dedicated legal and financial support, and custom token solutions. Hypershare uses the blockchain as a transfer infrastructure and secure record of ownership, providing a simple, composable transactional layer for the global venture ecosystem. Using our technical and legal platform, startups can create and issue digital equity directly to investors and employees. Additionally, Hypershare provides a number of fine-grain issuer controls and automated compliance verifications, as well an extensible library of legal agreements and modules. Importantly, the protocol is open, interoperable, and comes ready to integrate with external machine systems out of the box.

Fundamentally, Hypershare is a control structure. It harnesses trustlessness and governs interactions between parties allowing value to flow more efficiently. By creating a shared language for describing equity investments we can standardise interactions allowing people and organisations to work together in ways that would have never been possible before.

## For Founders

For founders, Hypershare provides a sophisticated suite of smart contracts for the issue and transfer of tokenised equity. These contracts will support an organisation throughout its life and serve as a shared public utility for ventures and investors alike. An organisation's profile will act much like an email address or social media profileâ€”a reliable reference point built for a specific utility.

By tokenizing shares, Hypershare makes it drastically faster, simpler and cheaper for companies to manage equity and begin to raise capital than through traditional means. Instead of needing dedicated support, founders can deploy a suite of smart contracts at the price of gas. These hybrid legal contracts enforce rights both on-chain and off-chain thereby bridging the gap between traditional and decentralised finance.

To support registered assets in a way that is flexible, non-invasive, and scalable Hypershare has created a suite of automated compliance checks that are instrumental in making the compliance process painless. By enforcing compliance as a part of the architecture of the market we can shift the burden onto code and away from users creating a truly frictionless experience that allows value to flow freely.
        
## For Investors

Hypershare allows investors to engage broadly in on-chain venture investment, trading and governance directly from their smart wallets. We hope to be for tokenised equity what Uniswap and Opensea were for their retrospective communities, pioneers of thriving ecosystems that created value for millions of users.

Illiquidity is the single greatest problem in the venture investment industry. It compounds risk, increases the difficulty of every other process and constrains the market based on the type of opportunity investors can realise an exit on. Greater liquidity will not only benefit investors but have direct knock-on effects for founders who seek to raise funding and ultimately, broaden the scope of venture investment allowing it to support a more diverse range of opportunities.

## For Developers 

In the current landscape there are countless equity crowdfunding platforms, the majority of which develop proprietary software to support their operations. Not only is this inefficient but it silos value. For developers Hypershare can be easily integrated via the SDK meaning that each platform can continue to provide individual services for their respective while creating open and composable digital assets that are recorded on the blockchain.

As a platform for programmable value the blockchain opens up a multitude of exciting new use cases, one example of which is on-chain voting. By conducting shareholder votes on-chain it is possible to allow investors to engage directly in the governance no matter how small their shareholding. This is just one of a multitude of use cases that would have previously been impractical or impossible before tokenisation.

## Other Uses

Based on the popular ERC-1155 token standard.  

While Hypershare was designed to represent equity, it is flexible enough to represent any asset, from tokenised IP to property.
