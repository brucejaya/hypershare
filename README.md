# Hypershare

*Welcome to Hypershare: a digital equity infrastructure for the internet age.*

## What's the problem?

DeFi is finance for the age of the internet, an open global financial system running atop the blockchain. DeFi offers the first radical alternative to the disconnected, opaque, decades-old practices and infrastructure of traditional finance. Having grown from a relative backwater into a thriving several hundred billion industry almost overnight, the community today is at the centre of a technical revolution that will eventually subsume the entire financial sector. But what about the other $27 trillion in capital markets? DeFi has survived up until now by avoiding regulated assets but for the space to evolve a new type of protocol must emerge.

We believe that decentralised finance is an opportunity to transform the analogue, disconnected and opaque infrastructure of venture investment today. Yet, despite their vast potential the blockchain and DeFi remain arcane and inaccessible to outsiders.Our mission is to broaden access to the blockchain and allow venture founders and investors to harness its radical potential. The collision between regulated assets and permissionless protocols presents a unique set of technical, ethical, and regulatory challenges. Current solutions for building compliant solutions centralise control and reintroduce middlemen who extract value from users and prevent the space from evolving. If the growth of regulated assets in decentralised finance is dependent on intermediaries, it seems doubtful they will ever see wider adoption.

## What is Hypershare?

Hypershare is a sophistictaed ___ for asset tokenisation

Hypershare allows entrepreneurs to create and manage tokenised equity, automate compliance and raise venture funding. For investors, Hypershare provides a platform to realise unprecedented liquidity on assets that would have previously been immobile, enabling equity shares to be traded like any other crypto asset. H

Although Hypershare was developed with the equity shares in mind, the ___ is flexible enough represent a wide array of real world asset (RWA), from tokenized IP to real estate. 

Hypershare harnesses trustlessness and governs interactions between parties, allowing value to flow more efficiently. By creating a shared language for describing equity investments and other tokenized assets we can standardise interactions allowing people and organisations to work together in ways that would never before have been possible.


## Asset tokenisation

### Tokens

In DeFi, transactions are settled directly on the blockchain. As a result, they don’t allow for the use of fiat currency. Instead, they deal exclusively with crypto assets such as tokens. A token is a blockchain-native digital asset that typically represents a unit of ownership. Tokens can be used in a variety of ways. For example, a token may be used to represent a certain amount of currency in a financial transaction, or, alternatively, a token could be used to represent a vote in an online poll. Tokens typically belong to one of two common categories: 

*Exchange tokens*: are intended as a decentralised tool that allows holders to access goods and services without the use of traditional intermediaries. The FCA states that “[exchange] tokens are designed to provide limited or no rights for token holders, and there is usually not a single issuer to enforce rights against”.

*Utility tokens*: grant the bearer the ability to perform certain actions within a specific ecosystem. These tokens often enforce rights on-chain by interfacing directly with a protocol's contracts. The FCA goes on to state that “[utility] tokens grant holders access to a current or prospective product or service but do not grant holders rights that are the same as those granted by specified investments”.

### Security Tokens

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of blockchain for asset tokenisation. In particular, for “security tokens”. A security token is a unit of ownership recorded on the blockchain. Security tokens are distinct from unregulated tokens, such as exchange and utility tokens, in that they often represent asset value external to the blockchain that grant the holder rights enforced by the law. Such assets may include shares, bonds, and property, among others.

Security tokens are typically classified based on whether they provide the same rights and obligations as traditional securities, and regulated based on their shared substantive properties. Importantly, for security tokens to be recognised and issued as such to investors, they must meet the requirements specified under applicable securities laws for similar fiat instruments. As security tokens sit within established regulatory frameworks, traditional issuers and investors can engage with much greater confidence. Security tokens are increasingly seen as an inevitable evolution of mainstream securities, as they provide many of the assurances and controls of traditional securities with enhanced transferability and settlement. Securities tokenisation is still a nascent space and has not yet seen large-scale adoption, but is likely to grow in the coming years. This growth will be driven by the significant advantages offered by the blockchain as well as by increasing institutional interest in the underlying technology. A number of major financial institutions, such as the Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, and Goldman Sachs, have already invested in blockchain startups. Venture Capital investment in blockchain reached a record $33 billion in 2021 3 . In addition, a number of countries, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, are currently exploring the use of blockchain for securities tokenisation.

#### Benefits
Tokenisation provides a powerful platform for issuers. With the blockchain providing a secure, transparent and tamper-proof means of record-keeping, security tokens present a number of advantages over traditional stock exchanges or asset registries.

#### Efficiency
Tokenised assets bypass the need for manual procedures as transactions are settled directly on the blockchain. This dramatically reduces settlement time and enables “24/7” trading, which is not possible via traditional exchanges.

#### Cost
Blockchain reduces cost for issuers as processes are automated and built atop public internet infrastructure. This eliminates the need for private order routing networks and complex, highly intermediated settlement procedures.

#### Security
Blockchain technology is more secure than traditional forms of manual record keeping, as the system state is recorded and stored across thousands of computers.

#### Compliance
Blockchain enables compliance to be implemented directly at the protocol level, making it easier to and less error prone to manage and enforce complex procedures.

#### Liquidity
With assets encoded on a public blockchain network and transfers assured by non-legal mechanisms, token holders benefit from significantly increased asset transferability. This is particularly meaningful in illiquid markets, such as venture investment.

#### Transparency
The blockchain creates a single record of truth that is independent and all parties can trust. This synchronised state is updated automatically and can be accessed from anywhere on Earth.

#### Composability
Composability allows entire ecosystems of assets and protocols to work together synergistically. This means innovative new product offerings to be built atop existing ones, leveraging the resources made available by its predecessors and in turn, adding value to them.

# Barriers to Adoption
** However, for security tokens to see wider adoption, there are a number of foundational issues that must be resolved.**

## Intermediaries  
Broad financial disintermediation is one of the most important advances introduced by the blockchain. Disintermediation has eliminated middlemen from financial transactions by provisioning solutions directly between buyers and sellers creating a more efficient ecosystem. Unfortunately, the security token space has not kept pace with such advances. Instead of disintermediation, current approaches to building compliant services directly reintroduce gatekeepers.  

#### Extractive  
Financial intermediaries create a conflict of interest and introduce unnecessary friction. While these platforms frequently advertise themselves as ‘democratising access to investing’, they rarely transpire to be the great democratising force they assert themselves to be. Typically, such services charge a minimum 5-10% fee on funds raised. This gives them a strong short-term incentive to maximise profits and entrench themselves as volume-based market leaders, often to the detriment of their users.  

#### Opinionated  
Intermediaries are opinionated. They conduct due diligence, endorse particular opportunities and charge fees with the aim of turning a profit. This gives them reason to prioritise the opportunities that they believe will generate the greatest return. Unfortunately, this selective approach ostracises large portions of the market. Arguably, the blockchain should provide a transformative platform that is capable of supporting a much broader range of opportunities that may have struggled in traditional markets, such as impact investment.

#### Disconnected
With centralised services the value offering is based on that of individual companies. Unlike DeFi services, security token platforms compete and scale like traditional businesses. This constrains the growth potential of the ecosystem based on the scalability of their internal procedures (e.g. due diligence, marketing, etc).

Formalisation

The legal and regulatory system has been slow to modernise in the wake of blockchain. Consequently, there is still a necessary “real world” foundation that is yet to be established.

Compliant

The vast majority of tokens are designed to be permissionless, meaning they can be exchanged freely. However, as with traditional securities, tokenised securities are still subject to regulation and required to conform to compliance standards. The only way to effectively scale regulated assets in decentralised markets is with adequate on-chain compliance controls.

Secure

Token issuers must also be able to perform more sophisticated management operations such as forcing token transfers for legal reasons or fund recovery, as well as freezing and partially freezing tokens.

Machine-readable

Contracts, even in electronic form, legal agreements have failed to keep pace with advances in technology. In the current paradigm legal contracts are rendered in plain text via files such as Word documents or PDFs. Rather than creating a digital version of the underlying data, these documents are recorded in a digital format to capture important information in a convenient, transferable format. Without some type of aggregating framework that presents key information in a machine-readable format, it is extremely difficult for machines to work with the information contained within such files.

# Hypershare
In the same way that physical systems converge toward the path of least resistance, users naturally tend toward the solutions that offer the greatest convenience. For this reason, unlike its competitors, Hypershare has chosen to separate the notion of equity tokenisation from equity token offerings (“ETOs”). Asset tokenisation offers an array of benefits over contemporary solutions. However, it is by no means a simple process. Token issuance is still dependent on an array of actors such as advisors, law firms, broker-dealers, KYC/AML providers, custody agents, cap table management solutions, and more. Much like conventional crowdfunding campaigns, what is often perceived as a simple, effective form of alternative funding comes with its own set of drawbacks and considerations. While the concepts of equity tokens and equity token sales are highly interrelated, they are not mutually dependent. Whereas token sales are dependent on tokenisation of the underlying asset, tokenisation does not demand a blockchain-based public offering as its primary distribution method. ETOs are neither necessary nor appropriate for the majority of users and introduce a litany of regulatory and legal considerations that massively increase cost and complexity. As yet, there has not been a product that has realised digital equity to its full potential. It is our belief that tokenised equity, as a mature, digital-native asset, is more than viable as a standalone product. Therefore, Hypershare exclusively targets private, primary market transactions between issuers and accredited investors. By removing ETOs from the core product offering, issuing digital equity requires very little behavioural change or commitment on the part of users. Whereas tokenisation could easily take several months from end-to-end, without the regulatory and legal concerns that accompany large public crowdsales, issuers may start to see the benefits within as little as half an hour. Part of what makes Hypershare’s value offering so compelling is that it is so simple. Instead of manually sharing legal agreements in PDF form, signing them physically or with something like DocuSign, manually updating the shareholder register and issuing share certificates, Hypershare provides a sophisticated tool for both issuers and investment professionals to streamline their legal, administrative, and transactional activities into a single, integrated process.

In this regard, Hypersurface creates a new digital utility, much like email or file sharing. One that we hope both issuers and investors will come to use on a daily basis. This utility offers what we believe to be a leading-edge solution, not just in the domain of asset tokenisation, but in creating blockchain-based applications for mainstream commercial adoption. 

The key distinction between Hypersurface and contemporary equity management solutions is that, rather than using disconnected private records, Hypersurface makes use of the blockchain to create a synchronised record of ownership. One that is open and accessible and can be integrated immediately by other actors in the ecosystem. With ownership and transaction infrastructure secured by the blockchain, information is rendered and available to read and write by anyone with the appropriate permissions. This may be a shareholder transferring shares, or a third-party application. 

Open, standardised protocols have been instrumental in the development of many platforms, such as the web. In the same way that a currency is only valuable in that it is a widely recognised means of exchange, the more broadly digital equity assets are recognised, the more valuable they are. With this in mind, Hypersurface equity tokens have been developed under the ERC-1155 multi-token standard and come ready to integrate with an entire ecosystem of applications out of the box. 

From instant equity-backed loans to secondary markets trading and digital voting, the blockchain opens up a whole host of new and exciting use cases. While both analogue and digital equity may represent an equal stake in the underlying venture, digital equity has far greater use value and has greatly enhanced transferability. For this reason, we anticipate the value of Hypersurface digital equity to be greater than its analogue counterpart, and to increase significantly over time as more resources become available.

For a process that takes as little as half an hour, we see this as potentially the easiest way for an issuer to increase the value of an asset and the appeal of an investment opportunity.

### Tokenisation Process

1. Structuring
Configure the basic details of the asset by defining its name, ticker, supply and more. Structure the asset type and build the legal agreement from a library of modules.

2. Compliance
Define the compliance rules for the asset. This includes: total holder limits, jurisdictional restrictions, jurisdictional holder limits, non-fractionality, non-transferability, and more. Any whitelisted addresses are exempt, otherwise, compliance rules are enforced at the protocol-level.

3. Creation
Key information is encoded in a digital format. The token is deployed on the blockchain. Legal agreements are uploaded to IPFS.

4. Distribution
Invite and issue shares via a private invite link. Investors can create an account in a few simple clicks, review and cryptographically sign digital legal agreements and receive their shares. All in a single, integrated workflow.

5. Management
The share register is automatically rendered, updated, and may serve as the definitive record of a company's shareholders or can be exported to an offline share register. If issuers need to take action they have a suite of tools such as recovery, force transfers and freezing.

# Hypershare
One of the most important attributes of equity tokens, as compared to utility or exchange tokens, is that they are subject to existing securities laws. Therefore any design must make remain compliant with legal and statutory requirements. Furthermore, such a solution should provide issuers with a number of fine-grain controls and automations. As such, we identify a number of key attributes for equity tokens:

1. Be upgraded without changing the token smart contract address.
2. Implement multiple tokens in a single smart contract.
3. Embed legal agreements in a way that is secure and legally binding.
4. Apply any rule of compliance that is required by the token issuer or regulator.
5. Have a standard interface to pre-check if a transfer is going to pass or fail.
6. Provide an up-to-date list of token holders.
7. Have a recovery system in case an investor loses access to their account.
8. Be able to freeze tokens a shareholders wallet, partially or totally.

## Multi-token

The goal of Hypershare is to enable the issuance of equity in a way that is secure, compliant, and frictionless for users. As the ERC-20 standard was developed for standalone assets, any ERC-20-derived security token would require multiple redeployments of the same contract for each and every new asset, with little to no change between implementations. Needless to say, this is both inefficient and resource-intensive, particularly for use cases such as alphabet shares. Numerous disparate token implementations also increase security risk.

Unlike other permissioned tokens, at its core, Hypershare uses the ERC-1155 multi-token standard. While the ERC-20 requires a new and distinct smart contract for each token, the ERC-1155 uses a single smart contract to implement an arbitrary amount of tokens at once. When a new token is “created”, a unique identifier is created and added to the list of tokens contained within the contract. This identifier supplements the unique contract address associated with ERC-20 token implementations. Accordingly, the ERC-1155 features an additional function argument id as the unique identifier for each token. Although the contract is shared between multiple tokens, the accounting for each token, operator controls, and compliance controls are kept separate. This approach leads to significant gas savings as compared to that used by the ERC-20 standard, allowing issuers to create new assets at a fraction of the cost and complexity. 

## Protocol-level Compliance Controls
A unique feature of Hypershare is that it enforces compliance at the protocol level. Unlike the ERC-20, where token transfers only fail due to the user having an inadequate balance, Hypershare transactions can fail for a variety of reasons. These include the receiver not having verified KYC information, assets having been locked or frozen, and economic and jurisdictional constraints such as investor, acquisition, and geographic limits. Somewhat counterintuitively, we believe that stronger transfer controls will increase transferability as without them (a) regulators will not permit large-scale tokenisation of regulated assets, and (b) issuers will not support automatic transfer resolution on-chain.

## Advanced Issuer Controls
Hypershare features a number of advanced issuer controls designed to facilitate effective and secure equity tokenisation. In order to do so it is essential that issuers are have options such as freezing assets, partially freezing assets, force transferring assets, and recovering assets for holders. To this end, Hypershare introduces a number of new functions allowing issuers to perform actions, including:

● pause/unpause
● recover
● unfreezePartialTokens/freezePartialTokens
● batchFreezePartialTokens/batchUnfreezePartialTokens
● setAddressFrozen
● batchSetAddressFrozen

## Upgradability
Hypershares functional logic may well see numerous upgrades throughout a company's life. To support upgradability, token accounting is separated from the underlying logic. This means that the overall state is maintained between upgrades.

## Non-fractional Shares

Non-fractional shares introduce significant usability errors, particularly for services that are reliant on fractional fees, such as liquidity pools. Previous approaches to non-fractional shares simply set to the token to zero decimal places, as opposed to the conventional eighteen. The issue is that this design is hard to reverse once tokens are released. Instead, to support non-fractional shares Hypersurface simply enforces non-fractional token transfers. If a transfer creates fractional shares it will  fail.

## Metadata

In order to give on-chain representation to real-world legal agreements, and do so in a way that is legally and cryptographically binding, the equity token contract must give equal precedent to legal agreements and the corresponding metadata. Hypershare makes use of the ERC-1155’s metadata URI to attach a structured JSON legal schema that provides information about the underlying agreement in a machine-readable format. For more information see regarding asset metadata see Hyperframe: Hyperlabs solution to a machine-readable legal system.  

## Share Register

Hypersurface creates a share register with the primary proof of ownership maintained and updated directly on the blockchain. Each share in the share register is represented by an equity token, providing an immutable and secure record of shareholdings and transaction histories. Instead of requiring manual documentation and calculation the share register is automatically calculated and updated on each transfer. To remain compliant the share register must meet the requirements of a traditional share register. Although there are minor changes across jurisdictions, the fields typically that must be recorded are:

● Name
● Address
● Share class
● Number of shares
● Amount paid for shares
● Date person was registered as a member
● Date person ceased to be registered as a member

We believe that Hypersurface’s share register alone provides significant benefits over current register administration tools and methodologies by reducing inefficiency, overheads, and inaccuracy, ultimately providing companies with a more effective platform to comply with statutory obligations. As the share register can interface with external machine systems there is scope to further automate the process to provide a platform that automatically submits the necessary fillings when a transfer takes place.

## Compliance

Each and every transfer of Hypershare tokens is coupled with an on-chain validator system. The compliance smart contracts record and enforce transfer controls, ensuring that the transfer and recipient are eligible. Compliance can be used to define and enforce a variety of controls such as accepted countries, the maximum number of investors per country, the maximum number of shares per holder, the accreditation status of the holder and more.

The compliance contracts then read the properties of the asset and interacting identities and enforce certain behaviours, either returning true or false based on the eligibility status of the transfer. When a transfer is made the token contract makes a function call to the compliance contracts to verify the eligibility of (a) the transfer and (b) the receiver. The compliance contracts enforce logic that will check the parameters of the token itself such as holder limits and the claims of the receiver's account. Should all requirements be met the compliance contracts will return true approving the transfer, or false otherwise.

The compliance contracts provide an open, programmable means of automating compliance, shifting much of the burden away from users and onto the protocol. This greatly aids in increasing transferability, as in combination with the Hyperbase identity, system much of the menial work of validating KYC and other credentials can be eliminated entirely.

For its initial release Hypersurface is targeting a set of rules and transfer controls that are universally applicable. However, as the protocol grows we hope to be able to add further fidelity to the compliance contracts, implementing new rules in accordance with jurisdictional requirements. With the development of the compliance contracts, we expect to see the emergence of greatly increased liquidity.

### Limit Holder
The limit holder compliance smart contract enforces limit-based transfer controls, such as ensuring the maximum number of holders or specific jurisdictional limits have not been exceeded. Limit holder manages frozen tokens, wallets and ensures that tokens are not transferred while paused or in non fractional quantities if required.

### Claims Required
The claims required compliance smart contract verifies that the receiver is either whitelisted and therefore exempt, or that the receiver has the appropriate claims to receive equity tokens. Instead of manually checking each interaction the compliance contracts can be used to define essential properties. Claims can be used to verify the properties of an account on-chain.

## Structure
The metadata records the key terms contained within the agreement in a machine-readable format.
The markdown records and captures the terms of the legal agreement in a human-readable format.
A smart contract enforces the relevant the agreement on-chain.	

## Metadata

Hyperframe uses a metadata model to aggregate the key terms of an agreement in a machine-readable format. Providing metadata on the underlying agreement enables greatly enhanced flexibility. For Hypershare, metadata is embedded directly in the token URI and structured in much the same way as metadata for an NFT. This aggregates key information from the agreement and provides a way for agreement data to be indexed and utilised by third parties.

## Encoding

The process for creating and encoding legal smart contracts generates a secure link between objects. By creating a bidirectional connection that maps the intended relationship between the legal contract and the smart contract in the token URI, the process creates a cryptographically secure dual integration that ensures that information recorded off-chain is tamperproof.

In this example, we use a token holders agreement. The steps to create a smart legal contract are as follows:
	1. The user inputs data via the web application.
	2. This data is then used to create a structured metadata model using JSON.
	3. A new token is created in the Hypershare token contract with a unique identifier.
	4. The metadata model is updated with a reference to the unique identifier of the token.
	5. The compliance contract is updated with the terms of the agreement to be enforced on-chain from the structured data model, referencing the token identifier.
	6. The metadata is used to render the legal agreement in Markdown.
	7. The legal Markdown file is uploaded to IPFS.
	8. The metadata is updated with the legal agreement IPFS URI.
	9. The metadata JSON file is uploaded to IPFS.
	10. The Hypershare token is updated with the structured metadata model IPFS URI.
